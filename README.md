# __Project: :kronoTweeter__
---

Hopefully the first of many Twitter modules I hope to build into an application suite using the Twitter API.

**Purpose**
To generate an application that will act either as a bot or just a scheduled Tweet Application. Whichever trips your trigger, I suppose. My purpose in creating this application is to hone and sharpen my Ruby on Rails skills as well as learn about other methods of problem solving in the process.
